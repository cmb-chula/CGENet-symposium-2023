### Details
For this workshop, we briefly went over key considerations when analyzing pathogen genomic data, such as whether the seqeuencing data contain significant contaminant or host DNA, 
and what the primary investigative questions are.

Then, we outlined the bioinformatics steps involved and show online tools that can perform these tasks, namely:
1. [FastQC](https://www.bioinformatics.babraham.ac.uk/projects/fastqc/)
2. [Nextclade](https://clades.nextstrain.org/)
3. [Genome Detective](https://www.genomedetective.com/)
4. [Galaxy](https://galaxy.pasteur.fr/)
5. [Intractive Tree of Life](https://itol.embl.de/)
6. [IQ-Tree](http://www.iqtree.org/)
